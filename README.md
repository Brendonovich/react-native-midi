# react-native-midi
A Web MIDI API implementation for React Native (experimental, Android only at the moment)

# Goal

Run Web MIDI code unmodified anywhere React Native is supported.

# Status

Only Android is implemented, and even that is in a very early stage. It might not build. It might not work. But we'll get there!

# Help wanted

If this is going to be a robust, fully-featured and widely usable package, I'm going to need some help :smile:
See the Wiki and the issue tracker to get a sense of the current focus.
